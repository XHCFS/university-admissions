> **Goal:** finalize 2 more safety choices that (a) align with research fit, (b) are **No GRE**, and (c) offer **international fee waivers/free apps**.

---

## Quick To‑Dos

* [ ] **Request fee waivers now** for Targets added (Rice, UChicago, Notre Dame, Utah, UCSC). Many require early requests or short forms.
* [ ] **Verify deadlines** as 2026 admissions pages go live (most open Sep–Oct 2025).
* [ ] **Fix “Pittsburgh” link** to the CS PhD’s correct portal (GradCAS may not be the right one for CS).
* [ ] Identify **2 more safeties** with documented intl. fee waivers + No GRE.

---

## Notes

* All programs listed under Targets are **No GRE (required)**; several mark GRE as **optional**.
* “Fee Waiver Link” indicates an official page or departmental policy (free apps, waiver forms, or event-based waivers). Always submit the waiver request **before** paying.
